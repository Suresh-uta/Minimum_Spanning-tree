# Minimum_Spanning-tree
Finding minimum spanning tree using prim's Algorithm &amp; Krsukal Algorithm and Comparing their time complexities 
To run the code:
Download the .ipynb file
Import all the libraries properly and run the code
prim's & kruskal algorithm data structures are created separetly
u can change the maximum weights if needed
depending on the user input time complexities will change
